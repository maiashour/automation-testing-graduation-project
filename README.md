# 🧪 Automation Testing Project – AutomationExercise

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **automation testing** of the website [AutomationExercise](https://automationexercise.com),  
which provides multiple user flows for practicing web automation.  
The main goal was to automate and validate selected test cases (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 24) to ensure that key functionalities work correctly.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Automate the execution of major functional test cases.  
- Validate web elements, user interactions, and expected results.  
- Use assertions to verify correct page navigation and data handling.  
- Generate structured reports for pass/fail test results.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
- **Selenium WebDriver** → For browser automation  
- **TestNG** → For test execution and reporting  
- **Java** → Programming language used for automation scripts  
- **Maven** → For project build and dependency management  
- **ChromeDriver** → To run browser-based tests  
- **IDE:** Eclipse  

## 🧾 Test Cases Automated  
| Test Case # | Title | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| TC-1 | Register User | Automate registration with valid data and verify success message |
| TC-2 | Login User with correct credentials | Verify login flow using valid email & password |
| TC-3 | Login User with invalid credentials | Validate error message for wrong login |
| TC-4 | Logout User | Check logout functionality and redirection |
| TC-5 | Register User with existing email | Verify proper validation message |
| TC-24 | Download Invoice after Purchase | Automate full order flow and verify invoice download |

## 🔍 Types of Testing  
- Functional Automation Testing  
- Regression Testing  
- Smoke Testing  

## ✅ Results & Observations  
- All test scripts executed successfully using TestNG suite.  
- Automated validations for page navigation, UI elements, and messages worked as expected.  
- Minor synchronization issues were handled using explicit waits.  
- Test reports were generated with clear pass/fail status.  

## 👩‍💻 My Role

-Developed and executed Selenium scripts for each selected test case.
-Applied TestNG annotations to organize and manage test execution.
-C-onfigured Maven for dependency management and project setup.
-Executed tests, debugged failures, and generated automation reports..
